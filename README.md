# Forensic Wace

Welcome to the repository of Forensic Wace Server Edition, an upgrade of my Bachelor's thesis project in Computer Forensics. This project represents the result of my study focused on the extraction of chats and other informations contained inside the whatsapp database, extracted from Apple iOS devices.

## Installation

In order to start using the Forensic Wace Server Edition you need to install it.

To do this, open a terminal window as administrator and run the command below.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Alessiop01/ForensicWace-ServerEdition
```

## Usage
To start the Forensic Wace GUI, execute the command below in any terminal window:

```python
forensic-wace-se
```

Once the command to start the tool has been run on the server machine on which it will run, a web browser is needed to access the GUI. It is recommended to use Google Chrome as browser.
